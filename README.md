#ðŸš€ Ola Bike Ride Request Forecast using ML

This project predicts hourly ride requests using ML, leveraging features like season, weather, time, and holidays.

ðŸ”¹ Steps:

Feature Engineering: Extracted time-based and categorical features.

EDA: Visualized trends & removed outliers.

Model Training: Compared Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, RandomForest.

Best Model: RandomForestRegressor (lowest validation error).

ðŸ“Œ Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

ðŸ“Š Outcome: Random Forest delivers the best accuracy for ride demand prediction.
